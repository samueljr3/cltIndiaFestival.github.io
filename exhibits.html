      The culturally rich land of India celebrates various festivals on its soil. These festivals 
      beautify the life and experiences of people from different religions and communities. 
      The spirit of India is expressed year-round. Some of the world known festivals are: Holi,
      Diwali, Onam and Ramadan. Holi, often referred as the "Festival of Colors". This festival is 
      centered around religious beliefs but the real fun part involves people throwing colored powder 
      on each other and squirting each other with water guns. Diwali or Deepavali honors the victory of good
      over evil and brightness over darkness. It's known as the "Festival of Lights" for all the fireworks,
      small clay lamps, and candles that are lit. Another most celebrated festival is Onam. This lengthy harvest
      festival is the biggest festival of the year in the south India when people decorate front of their 
      houses with flowers arranged in beautiful patterns. The festivity of Ramadan is celebrated for a
      month in the Islamic culture in India. Sawm or fasting is observed throughout the Ramadan month. 
      It is a time of spiritual reflection, improvement and increased devotion and worship.

        Is a system of physical, mental and spiritual practices which have been traced back to pre-Vedic
        times (500 BCE) in the Indian subcontinent. Over the centuries, its practice has been adapted 
        and assimilated by Hindus, Buddhists and Jains. Today, its use has become widespread among 
        the religious and the secular alike. Displays in this exhibit cover a wide range of general 
        themes like history of yoga and its different varieties and also more specific themes, like 
        chakra and yogic therapies. Yoga experts will be at hand to answer your questions.
